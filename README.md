# 🚗 Gender and Vehicle Classification using HOG + SVM

This project classifies gender and vehicle types from grayscale images using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. It includes preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and a Tkinter-based GUI for image selection.

## ✅ Features

- Gender classification (Male/Female)
- Vehicle classification (Car, Bike, etc.)
- HOG feature extraction
- SVM model training and accuracy evaluation
- GUI interface using Tkinter for image input

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- scikit-image
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- Tkinter
- Pillow

## 📊 Output

- Accuracy metrics for classification
- Visualization of HOG features
- GUI-based image prediction demo
